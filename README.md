## Teaching kids to code

There are two parallel directory structures in both the main directory branch and the testing 'spec' path. One is
for problems. The problem path has failing unit tests written against skeleton code with little to no implementation.
The second is for solutions which has passing unit tests with discussions as well as fully implemented solutions with
in-lined descriptions that describe what is going on.

In some instances, language-specific coding conventions are not followed to make a point. An example of this is that values
on the last line of a Ruby method/function the keyword 'return' is applied so that kids can see the explicit return
rather than the implied no-return last line typical in Ruby.
